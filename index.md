### Our Project

YALA is a lightweight Java Swing application made for storing your grocery lists. It gives you the ability to create, duplicate, delete lists. You can add items, cross off / uncross items, or delete items from list. We have implemented stores that you can search through in order to find items to add to your list, and our app supports creating different users.
